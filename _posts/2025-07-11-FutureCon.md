I had the great pleasure of attending the Anaheim FutureCon Cybersecurity Conference yesterday and I want to talk about the messages given from Ron Pelletier, Founder of Pondurance, and John Minasyan, COO of LMNTRIX, because they both echoed a theme that carried on through the rest of the event. I made sure to visit each company’s booth in an attempt to gain insight into the current trajectory and there was one constant that always needed to be addressed: the increasing power of threat actors due to AI.

With the ocean of knowledge and complexity of architecting strategic digital defenses it is easy to fall victim of imposture syndrome. But actually, that is exactly how we all should feel in the current digital environment.  

Ron spoke of the need to define and accept a certain amount of risk and increasing our efforts to be proactive in the cycle of threat detection. No profitable business can operate with data protection at the level of Fort Knox but new vulnerabilities are now being exploited within days. Malicious entities have access to tools which are increasing in power at an alarming rate due to AI advancements. If we are waiting until logs analyzed in our SIEMS.. its probably too late.

John began his message discussing the myth that cybersecurity is a solved problem. Its not. There have been far too many data breaches from well-known company’s that clearly had strong policies and defenses and yet were still exploited. While its natural for the industry to market the strength of our products as impenetrable, the truth is that despite our best efforts we can never assume that we are protected.

Nevertheless that does not mean that we should not value these tools. Actually, the main insight is quite the contrary. Active utilization and education are the two most important defenses that we have. I was quite impressed by the advancements being brought forth by the sponsoring companies. Special shoutout to ThreatLocker for pushing the idea of ZeroTrust to every boundary possible (especially the application level). Proofpoint for not only providing both active defense API integration but focusing on the pushing strategic insights on their website as well.

As the line between our digital and physical world becomes increasingly thin, I am proud to say that even with top certifications, 10+ years of experience in administrative positions, and creating more than 200 educational videos, my thirst for knowledge only seems to increase. If you feel uncomfortable in this industry: Good. We need you to keep growing. 

Thank you to all of the Sponsors and FutureCon for your tireless efforts to protect our infrastructure and privacy. Despite the real danger that we all face, I walked away feeling inspired, motivated, and excited for the future.

-Aaron
