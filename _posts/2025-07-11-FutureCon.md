"It is a false myth that cybersecurity is a solved problem." - John Minasyan COO of LMNTRIX July 10, 2025



With the ocean of knowledge and complexity of architecting strategic digital defenses it is easy to fall victim of imposture syndrome. But actually, that is exactly how we all should feel in the current digital environment.  



I had the great pleasure of attending one of FutureCon CyberSecurity Events at the Anaheim convention center yesterday and possibly the most profound takeaway is that we are losing the fight for security.



While it's natural for the industry to market the strength of products as impenetrable, the truth is that despite our best efforts we are not truly protected. There is a long list of reputable company's with seemingly strong defenses that have been recently breached. 



So what do we do?



Well for one, it does not mean that we should lose faith in our strategies and tools. Actually, the main insight is quite the contrary. Active utilization and education are the two most important defenses that we have.  We must continuously proactively develop. 



I am proud to say that even with top certifications, 10+ years of experience in administrative positions, and creating more than 200 educational videos, my thirst for knowledge only seems to only grow.



In the last month I continued upskilling into more technical areas. I completed Jason Dion's courses on CySA+ and LPI Linux Essentials as well as George Ntani's Splunk Series. I built a homelab environment to simulate corporate network attacks. And I created a blog using GitHub pages to showcase my efforts and hopefully inspire others to do the same. 



If you feel uncomfortable in this industry: Good. We need you to keep growing.
