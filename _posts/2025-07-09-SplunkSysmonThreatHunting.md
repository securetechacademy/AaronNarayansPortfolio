Welcome to my blog! My name is Aaron Narayan and this is where I share my cybersecurity projects with Splunk, Linux, VirtualBox, SOC labs, and GRC Documentation & Auditing.  This post contains screenshots from a threat hunting exercise with Splunk and Sysmon Events. I installed the add on to input Sysmon, input a new index of data, and then searched for Indicators of Compromise. Below are the steps covered and a Google Doc containing screenshots. Thank you for visiting. In the next blog I will produce a SOC 2 Report. 

### Covered Modules

 - Install Splunk Add-on for Sysmon
 - Input Sysmonsplunklab Index
 - Find suspicious executable
 - Find hash of suspicious executable
 - Look for Event Code 22 (DNS) At around the Time the File was Executed
 - Find the cloud source associated with the threat via Query name field 
 - Find PDF that was timestomped via EventCode=2 pdf
 - Find where once.cmd was written to via EventCode=11
 - Find destination ip via EventCode=3
 - Find what time was the process terminated via EventCode=5
