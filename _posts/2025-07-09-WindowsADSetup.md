Welcome to my blog! My name is Aaron Narayan and this is where I share my cybersecurity projects with Splunk, Linux, VirtualBox, SOC labs, and GRC Documentation & Auditing.  This post contains screenshots from the Windows AD Setup for SOC lab. I created a domain controller and then joined it with two separate VMs with static IP and DNS connection. Below are the steps covered and a Google Doc containing screenshots. Thank you for visiting. The next blog will be a threat hunting exercise with Splunk and Sysmon. 

### Covered Modules

 - Install Windows Server Edition on VirtualBox and Set up Network Adapter
 - Rename PC to ECorp
 - Server Manager Setup - Add Roles and Features Wizard
 - Set up Windows Server Certificate Authority 
 - Set up Static IP Assignment and Gateway
 - Set up User Roles and Groups
 - Set Static IP Address & Gateway
